% Solve a Pattern Recognition Problem with a Neural Network

% This script assumes these variables are defined:
%
%   input - input data.
%   outcome - target data.

x = input';
t = outcome';

% Choose a Training Function
% For a list of all training functions type: help nntrain
% 'trainlm' is usually fastest.
% 'trainbr' takes longer but may be better for challenging problems.
% 'trainscg' uses less memory. Suitable in low memory situations.
trainFcn = 'trainscg';  % Scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation.

% Create a Pattern Recognition Network
hiddenLayerSize = 15;
net = patternnet(hiddenLayerSize, trainFcn);

% Setup Division of Data for Training, Validation, Testing
net.divideParam.trainRatio = 70/100;
net.divideParam.valRatio = 15/100;
net.divideParam.testRatio = 15/100;

% Train the Network
[net,tr] = train(net,x,t);

% Test the Network
y = net(x);
e = gsubtract(t,y);
performance = perform(net,t,y)
tind = vec2ind(t);
yind = vec2ind(y);
percentErrors = sum(tind ~= yind)/numel(tind);

% View the Network
view(net)

% Plots
% Uncomment these lines to enable various plots.
% figure, plotperform(tr)
% figure, plottrainstate(tr)
% figure, ploterrhist(e)
% figure, plotconfusion(t,y)

% Save the Model
% Remember to rename this 
% note that the .mat file will also have the previous networks in it
